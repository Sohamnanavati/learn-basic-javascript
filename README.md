This repository contains my JavaScript learning notes covering objects, arrays, strings, dates, Set and Map, classes, iterations, regex (basics), FormData, JSON, cookies &amp; storage, async code, DOM, and BOM. 
Notes are beginner-friendly. contact me at sohamnanavati.14@gmail.com for any query or questions.

I have numbered the files in sequence (for example, 1_object, 2_array, and so on). Please follow this order, as it will make the concepts easier to understand. Within each file, most of the code is commented out. This is intentional—I have avoided using many variables to keep the examples simple and clear. Please uncomment one block of code at a time and run it, then comment it again before moving on to the next block. This step-by-step approach will help you clearly see which block of code produces which output.
